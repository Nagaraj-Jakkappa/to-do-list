## 💡 My Experience
This project is very special to me because it’s the **first one I’m uploading to GitHub**.  
While building it, I learned:  
- How to structure a project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- How JavaScript interacts with the DOM to add and remove tasks  
- Basics of using Git and GitHub for version control  

Uploading this project gave me confidence to continue building and sharing my work. 🚀
